# PupilDetect
pupil detection - HCI project(2020)

This repository contains the codes for two projects. One is the a client-server software which run a nback game meanwhile run the pupil detection algorithm on the client-end, then send the data to the server-end.
The other one is the pupil detect algorithm, in algor/pupil_detect.py.
(Noted, the pupil detect algorithm in the nback project is not updated.)
